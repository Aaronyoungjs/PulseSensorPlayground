# [PulseSensor.com](https://pulsesensor.com) Playground

This Playground is a collection of code for the most popular uses of PulseSensor and Arduino.  

- The playgroud includes a number of projects, with the code already written-out and commented! ü§ò¬†
- Use this code to get started quickly, or do advanced stuff. üëç
- Once you download the playground, you can simply access each project's code inside the Arduino IDE (software). üíª
- Contritube your project code back to the GitHub hive-mind. üêù


## Playground Projects Include: 
### Start Here:  
  Plug your sensor in for the first time!  See the best practises to get the best signal.  
- Project Page: https://pulsesensor.com/pages/code-and-guide

### Calculate BPM:  
  Focus-in on the code that calculates a user's HeartRate Beats Per Minute, "BPM".    
  Plug your sensor in for the first time!  See the best practises to get the best signal.

## How to Download and Install ü§®¬†
 
 1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and [Processing](https://processing.org/)
2. Download the .ZIP file of this library.
2. Start the Arduino IDE
3. In the IDE, Select Sketch / Include Library / Add .ZIP Library...
4. In the resulting dialog, navigate to the downloaded .ZIP of this library.
5. Follow the instructions to install this library.
6. Once this library is installed...
3. In the IDE, Select one of the examples under File / Examples / PulseSensor Playground.
4. Wire your circuit: Connect the Pulse Sensor signal to the Arduino's A0; connect an LED and 220 ohm resister in series between pin 5 and ground (GND).
5. Follow the rest of the instructions in [the original Processing example](https://github.com/WorldFamousElectronics/PulseSensor_Amped_Processing_Visualizer)
  * **Note**: In the Processing code, the line "println(Serial.list());" isn't compatible with Processing 3.0.  You'll need to change that line to "printArray(Serial.list());"
  * **Note2**: The [Arduino 101 specs page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoard101) says the analog input is "...from ground to 3.3 volts", so experiment with powering the PulseSensor from 3.3V vs. 5V and see which works better for you.

 
 ## Physical Connections üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª¬†
 
 1. A computer that can run the: [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and 
 2. An Arduino Board
 3. A PulseSensor from PulseSensor.com
