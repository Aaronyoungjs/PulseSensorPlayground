# [PulseSensor.com](https://pulsesensor.com) Playground
```
This Playground is a collection of code of the most popular uses of PulseSensor and Arduino.  

- The playgroud includes a number of projects, with the code already written-out and commented! ü§ò¬†
- Use this code to get started quickly, or do advanced stuff. üëç
- Switch between projects right in the Arduino IDE (software). üíª
- Contritube your projects code back to the GitHub hive-mind. üêù
```

## First, install the PulseSensor Playground Library

<<<<<<< HEAD
We put together a [handy guide](https://github.com/biomurph/PulseSensorPlayground/blob/master/Installing%20Pulse%20Sensor%20Playground.md) to walk you through getting setup with Arduino and our Pulse Sensor code. We also have a [dive in](https://github.com/biomurph/PulseSensorPlayground/blob/master/resources/PulseSenaor%20Playground%20Tools.md) to the function-ality of the library.

## Playground Project Descriptions: 


### Start Here:  
  Plug your sensor in for the first time!  Blink an LED with your pulse, live. 
  
- [**Project Page**](https://pulsesensor.com/pages/code-and-guide)

---

### Calculate BPM:  
  Focus-in on the code that calculates a user's HeartRate Beats Per Minute, "BPM".    
  Plug your sensor in for the first time!  See the best practises to get the best signal.

### Move a Motor to a live Heartbeat:  
  Make a servo motor pulse to your live heartbeat.

### Processing Visualizer:
  
  Get detailed visulization of the heart's pulse and behavior. Take the PulseSensor date into Processing.

### TroubleShoot Your Signal:  
  If you're having trouble seeing a heartbeat, make sure that you are using 'Goldilocks' pressure on the Pulse Sensor: Not too hard, not too soft. Squeezing the Pulse Sensor too hard against your skin will make the heartbeat go away, and not enough pressure will cause too much noise to creep in!
  
If you are seeing way too many Beats Per Minute, or you are getting lots of noise, try adjusting the `Threshold` setting. The Threshold variable tells Arduino when to find a pulse that is legit. Adjust this number (noted below with arrows) up for less sensitivity and down for more sensitivity. In the [**StarterProject**](https://pulsesensor.com/pages/code-and-guide) you can find the Threshold variable as shown in the pic below. In all the other examples, the `THRESHOLD` varialbe is defined at the top of the code.
