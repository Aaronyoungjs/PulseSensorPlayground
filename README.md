# PulseSensorBPM
An Arduino library based on Joel Murphy's and Yury Gitman's Pulse Sensor Amped Sketch.

This library enables Sketches that use either Timer Interrupts or delayMicroseconds() to achieve the timing per sample.

Tested on Arduino 101 and Arduino Uno.

Status January 17, 2016: folding the code in.
