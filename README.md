# [PulseSensor.com](https://pulsesensor.com) Playground
```
This Playground is a collection of code for the most popular uses of PulseSensor and Arduino.  

- The playgroud includes a number of projects, with the code already written-out and commented! ü§ò¬†
- Use this code to get started quickly, or do advanced stuff. üëç
- Once you download the playground, you can simply access each project's code inside the Arduino IDE (software). üíª
- Contritube your project code back to the GitHub hive-mind. üêù
